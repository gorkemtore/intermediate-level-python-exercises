# Instructions
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

# DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Example Output
# [2, 8, 34]

# numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# even_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
# print(even_numbers)

# with open("./nato-alphabet-project/file1.txt") as file1:
#     numbers_1 = [int(n[0]) for n in file1.readlines()]

# with open("./nato-alphabet-project/file2.txt") as file2:
#     numbers_2 = [int(n[0]) for n in file2.readlines()]

# common_numbers = [n for n in numbers_1 if n in numbers_2]
# print(f"Common numbers : {common_numbers}")

# sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"

# result = {word:len(word) for word in sentence.split()}
# print(result)
